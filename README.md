# melodic similarity
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/freakimkaefig/melodicsimilarity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/freakimkaefig/melodicsimilarity)

This work describes the conception and implementation of an information system for explorative melody analysis. The object of investigation consists of resources for folk music research from the Regensburger Liedblattsammlung. Through the possibilities of machine processing of musical pieces a web-based access to the digital indexed songsheets is created. Therefore, techniques from the area of music information retrieval, in particular the melodic similarity, are used in order to be able to search the inventory for melodic pa erns. The connection to the already digitally edited lyrics and meta information of the songsheets also offers the possibility to search the collection for a variety of parameters, as well as words or phrases within the lyrics.
